## Philosophy

As quoted on [@isaacs](https://www.npmjs.com/~isaacs) post ["Unix Philosophy and Node.js"](https://blog.izs.me/2013/04/unix-philosophy-and-nodejs), [Doug McIlroy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy) 4-point formulation of the [Unix Philosophy](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html):


1. **Make each program do one thing well.**  
   To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.


2. **Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program.**  
   Don’t clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don’t insist on interactive input.


3. **Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks.**  
Don’t hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.


4. **Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task**,  
   even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you’ve finished using them.

[@isaacs](https://www.npmjs.com/~isaacs) then casts this into [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) centric terms. The [whole post](https://blog.izs.me/2013/04/unix-philosophy-and-nodejs) is worth the read, but here's a distillation:

- **Working** is better than perfect.
- **Focus** is better than features.
- **Compatibility** is better than purity.
- **Simplicity** is better than anything.
