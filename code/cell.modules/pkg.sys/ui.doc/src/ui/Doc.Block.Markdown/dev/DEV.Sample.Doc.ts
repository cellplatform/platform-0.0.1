**Amazing** as \`this is\`, what is more incredible is that this dynamic holds true for human-built 
systems too. This scaling effect is the fundamental dynamic that makes companies work. 
As a business grows, it is essentially building a set of branching hierarchies that 
generate economies of scale using the [same mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10379) that mammals, insects and trees 
use to grow. As the company increases its size and adds more layers to its hierarchy, 
efficiencies are gained across all the layers in the hierarchy. This causes the unit 
cost of the goods it produces to fall as its size increases. This is known as sub-linear 
scaling, where the use of resources becomes more and more efficient as the system grows 
in size.

# Fractal hierarchies are finite

Systems that rely on scaling via fractal hierarchies can become incredibly efficient as 
they scale. But the downside of this dynamic is that these systems decay and die in very 
predictable ways. The lifespans of all animals are almost perfectly predicted by their 
size (for mammals, from a mouse 1-1.5 years, to an elephant 60-70 years, to a blue whale 
80-90 years).  
The bigger you are, the longer you live â€“ but all do die eventually.
