 *      From MDN documentation:
 *        Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to
 *        verify that resources they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without
 *        unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash
 *        that a fetched resource must match.
