A lightweight SSR (server-side-rendering) system for react apps bundled with ParcelJS and hosted on S3.

<p>&nbsp;<p>

#### Live Demo:
https://ssr.platform.uiharness.com  



<p>&nbsp;<p>

#### Highlights:

- Store assets on [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (or Digital Ocean [Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/)).
- Serve entry HTML from server (immediate load from "server-side-render").
- `307` redirect all other assets to S3/CDN (geo-edge cache).
- Manage lifecycle with simple command-line tools:
    - Bundle and push to S3 via command-line.
    - Manage versioned releases (with simple roll-backs) across multiple sites/environments.  
    (eg. `dev`, `staging`, `prod`)

## Setup

    yarn add @platform/react.ssr


<p>&nbsp;<p>


## Workflow

- Develop UI components on local dev-server within the [UIHarness](https://uiharness.com) or anything that can produce a javascript bundle (eg [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org)):

- Ensure the UI module has a `bundle` script within it's `package.json`.

- Create an `ssr.yml` configuration file for the server.

## Sample

The `/sample/now` and `/sample/server` are expecting a `.env` file with your S3 account information:

```
# 
# Digital Ocean "SPACES" or AWS "S3" connection secrets.
# 
SPACES_KEY="..."
SPACES_SECRET="..."

```

These are referenced within the `ssr.yml` config file.


#### Example sequence:

```bash
ðŸŒ¼
cd sample/ui
yarn start
```


Bundle a version and push it to S3:

```bash
ðŸŒ³
cd sample/server
yarn ssr bundle
```

Release bundled version by updating manifest:

```bash
ðŸŒ³
cd sample/server
yarn ssr release
```

Start local SSR server to test the bundle:

```bash
ðŸŒ¼
cd sample/server 
yarn start
```

Open in `http://localhost` browser (address/port exposed in server startup log).


<p>&nbsp;<p>

## Routes
The following system routes are exposed for examining meta-data about the current state and configuration of the server.

```
https://domain.com/.manifest
https://domain.com/.manifest/summary
https://domain.com/.manifest/summary/<site>
```
